## Other peoples boards:
### Fake-tec
https://github.com/gargomoma/fakeTec_pcb/
* An excellent design, using the outline of the Heltec v3 to take advantage of all the cases out there.
* Has a voltage divider built-in, with thru-hole or SMD resistors
* Can flush-mount the PCB to reduce height even further

### Cheapmesh - HT-CT62 based
https://gitlab.com/paulhausk/CheapMesh/-/tree/main
* Multiple options to power & interface
* Initial issue has native USB d+/d- switched - check before building
* Has components on the underside that make it harder to assemble

### Econotastic
https://sites.google.com/view/econotastic/home
* Uses RA-01SH, but can also use HT-RA62
* Changes in code not really required - see `TCXO_OPTIONAL`

### Mesh Heltec Tiny
